Mod board was created, should be used to replace AMP03s at U2 and U3.

In Rev B, input buffering to create an instrumentation amplifier will need to be added.


For correct functionality of the push buttons, cut the trace on the top copper going to the MCU, and solder a bodge wire to the capacitor.

That was a dumb mistake.

Add input protection on the programming header. Should be fine for rev A though.
